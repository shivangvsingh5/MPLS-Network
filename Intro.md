MPLS Simulation
NS-3 is one of the most important tools for Computer Networking Engineerings. In this project, I have simulated a label-switched network, using NS-3 tool.
In this project I have simulated network and calculated the lowest Time-to-Live (TTL) among all the nodes and sketching of Ingress Table has also been done..
