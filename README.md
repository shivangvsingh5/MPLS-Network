**SIMULATION OF LABEL-SWITCHING NETWORKS USING NS3 TOOL**

**GNS-3** is one of the most important tools for Computer Networking Engineerings. In this project, I have simulated a label-switched network, using GNS-3 tool. In this project I have simulated network and calculated the lowest Time-to-Live (T.T.L) among all the nodes and sketching of Ingress Table has also been done.
